// every instance, frame and view of a mesh surface with that material: its vertex attributes (through vertex() and the
// varyings), the material's uniforms and textures, constants. The time, the camera, the view-space vectors, the
// instance (its transform, instance uniforms, custom data), global uniforms and the facing all make it unbakeable.
